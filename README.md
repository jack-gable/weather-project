# MyWeather App üå¶Ô∏è

A modern weather app that uses the OpenWeatherAPI to accurately give the user their locations weather. Some key features of the app are the 5-day forecast and the search functionality that allows the user to search different locations weather.

Some of the challenges faced when building this project was accurately getting the users location and storing into state. Another challenge faced that was overcome was changing the color of the UI based on the weather data that was received through the API.

Some features that I'd like to implement in the future would be to add more functionality of getting the weather data based on the user's current location on first render. Another would be to convert this app to mobile platform using react-native.
